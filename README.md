# $gitcoin

The only token written entirely in TypeScript and pain.  
Built with caffeine, depression, and unresolved pull requests.

---

## 🧠 Why

Because building real apps is hard,  
and writing tokens for degenerates is emotionally safer.

---

## 🔥 Features

- ❌ No utility  
- ❌ No roadmap  
- ❌ No team standups  
- ✅ Just raw, unreviewed emotional commits

---

## 📦 Install

```bash
npm install git-coin --burnout
