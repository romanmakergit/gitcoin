# $gitcoin

The only token written entirely in TypeScript and pain.  
Built with caffeine, depression, and unresolved pull requests.

---

## 🧠 Why

Because building real apps is hard,  
and writing tokens for degenerates is emotionally safer.

---

## 🔥 Features

- ❌ No utility  
- ❌ No roadmap  
- ❌ No team standups  
- ✅ Just raw, unreviewed emotional commits

---

## 📦 Install

```bash
npm install gitcoin --burnout

```

## 🚀 Usage

```js
import { deploy } from "gitcoin";

deploy("to the mempool");

```

## Or, if you're already broken:

```js
if (mentalHealth < 0) {
  deploy("$gitcoin");
}

```

##📝 Known Issues

 • Compiles with tears

 • Breaks in prod and in life

 • Causes minor existential dread

 • Sometimes moon. Usually not.
